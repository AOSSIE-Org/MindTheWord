MindTheWord
===========
An extension for Google Chrome that helps people learn new languages while they browse the web.

MindTheWord helps the user to easily learn the vocabulary of a new language
while browsing pages in his native language. In every web page visited, it
randomly translates a few words into the language he would like to learn.
Since only a few words are translated, it is easy to infer their meaning from
the context.
