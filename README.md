## MindTheWord


An extension for Google Chrome that helps people learn new languages while they browse the web.

The extension is available for free at the 
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mind-the-word/fabjlaokbhaoehejcoblhahcekmogbom).


MindTheWord helps the user to effortlessly learn vocabulary of a new language
while browsing pages in his native language. In every webpage visited, it
randomly translates a few words into the language he would like to learn.
Since only a few words are translated, it is easy to infer their meaning from
the context.
