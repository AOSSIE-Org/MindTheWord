Quality of Translations
-----------------------

*Mind the Word* depends on the *Google Translate* and *Yandex Translate* services. Therefore, the quality of the translations provided by *Mind the Word* depends on the quality of these services. 



Blank Options Page
------------------

A few users have been experiencing a problem in which the options page is blank and no translation configuration can be created, as shown in the screenshot below:

ToDo: screenshot


This problem seems to be caused by failed storage or retrieval of the options in Google's synchronized storage servers when *Mind The Word* is installed and loaded for the first time. This may be due to a temporary communication problem with Google.

In order to solve this problem, please try the following:

1. uninstall the extension;

2. close chrome;

3. reopen chrome;

4. reinstall [Mind The Word](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mindtheword/fabjlaokbhaoehejcoblhahcekmogbom);

5. visit some webpage;

6. open the extension's options page;

This has been reported to work for other users. If it doesn't work for you, please [contact us](mailto:MindTheWord@gmail.com).
