		  	"Mind The Word" helps you to learn vocabulary of a new language while browsing pages in your native language. 
		  	</p>

		  	<p>
		  	In every webpage visited, it randomly translates a few words into the language that you would like to learn. By exposing you to only a few new words at a time and keeping them within context, it makes it easy for you to infer and memorize their meaning. If you need, you can hover the mouse over the translated word and wait a second, and the original word will be shown to you.
